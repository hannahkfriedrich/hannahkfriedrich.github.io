Insurance is a key tool for disaster recovery. Current research poorly explains how homeowners address complicated uncertainties and inequities in purchasing and using flood and wind insurance. This research assesses available insurance policy and claims datasets and interviews homeowners in New York State and Louisiana about their experiences to better understand insurance decision-making and its uneven impacts. This research is conducted in collaboration with Dr. Jack Zinda and Dr. Sharon Tennyson and funded by the Cornell Center for Social Sciences.
