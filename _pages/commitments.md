I am a geographer. My dissertation explores aligning satellite-based indicators of post-hurricane recovery with interviews and administrative records on heirship property, households’ use of homeowners insurance, and litigation with insurance companies. I use mixed methods to identify the socio-legal limitations households face in addressing losses from extreme events and how this creates uneven geographies of recovery. My research agenda is guided by working alongside disaster-impacted communities to translate inequities documented with various data sources to policymakers and advocate for more just climate adaptation. I earned my Master’s in Geography from Oregon State University and Bachelor’s in Geography and Geographic Information Systems/Cartography from the University of Wisconsin-Madison.
