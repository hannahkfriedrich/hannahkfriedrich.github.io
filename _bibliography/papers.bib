   abstract = {Despite the global refugee population's continued growth and the long-term habitation of many refugee settlements, there has been little overall attention from the Earth observation community toward environmental conditions and change in these settlements and their surrounding landscapes. However, considering the persistent concerns regarding the sustainability of environmental resource usage by refugees, potential environmental conflicts with nearby communities, and the impact of environmental hazards on refugee populations, it is crucial to gain a better understanding of the diverse and evolving refugee environment contexts using the unique information provided by Earth observation. In this chapter, we aim to demonstrate the value of using satellite imagery and satellite-derived data to map a refugee settlement in Uganda, estimate its population, and assess the land cover changes within and around the settlement.},
