	abstract = {This paper reiterates the intention and importance of positionality statements, encouraging researchers to approach positionality through vignettes to engage with our role and impact as scholars rather than as a formulaic description of a researcher's demographic characteristics and identities. We argue positionality can be a tool to strengthen hazards and disaster research, particularly when approached as an ongoing, iterative process.As early career researchers conducting fieldwork in the United States Gulf South, we considered the intention, importance and relevancy of positionality statements. We engaged in a collaborative writing process where we discussed our experiences in the field and revisited previously written reflexivity and positionality statements to create vignettes. Through the use of vignettes, we provide a path for researchers to reflect and disclose ethical and moral research considerations and power differentials that shape their research.Positionality statements can be limited and harmful when applied without critical examination of their intent and are at risk of being detrimental when recycled across multiple projects spanning distinct partnerships and place-based research endeavors. We suggest vignettes can serve a crucial function in developing ethical disaster-related research cognizant of its epistemological engagement with the topic, place of research and the people we engage in the field.Through vignettes, we provide a path to situate one’s positionality to further advance ethical disaster research intentional of reducing harm to communities at risk of disasters.},

	abstract = {Purpose
              The Disaster Justice Network ({DJN}) is a volunteer network that emerged during the {COVID}-19 pandemic to lend support and share critical information that was not easily accessed for the 2020 and 2021 Hurricanes Laura, Delta, Zeta and Ida recovery processes in coastal Louisiana. We discuss lessons learned on navigating challenges, questions and the possibilities for reducing harms and how these insights potentially transfer to other webs of mutual aid and hubs for community-driven actions focused on equitable and just disaster preparedness and recovery.
            
            
              Design/methodology/approach
              We employ an ongoing, iterative, non-linear process to nurture visions of a rejuvenated future based on the support of human and environmental rights. {DJN} draws from a community-based participatory action approach to develop and share strategies for achieving a justice-centered disaster preparedness and recovery process.
            
            
              Findings
              This initiative exposed the racism, violence and erasure of historied communities of color occurring through the official response process. It further brought to the public light the unjust, inequitable and harmful official recovery responses and what is urgently needed to support evacuees and survivors, moving towards a more just recovery process for future disasters. By understanding the historical context and complexities of co-occurring disasters and violence across space and time and what is required to mitigate the effect of these human-caused violations of humanity, we can begin to forcefully address the root causes of harm to more successful ends.
            
            
              Originality/value
              In all, {DJN} develops strategies to address inequitable disaster response and recovery, confront multiple intersecting and cascading disasters and pave the way for a better future together. This article's authors intend to offer our insights on this process and engage and learn collectively to advance justice-centered disaster planning, preparedness and recovery processes.},

   abstract = {Despite the global refugee population's continued growth and the long-term habitation of many refugee settlements, there has been little overall attention from the Earth observation community toward environmental conditions and change in these settlements and their surrounding landscapes. However, considering the persistent concerns regarding the sustainability of environmental resource usage by refugees, potential environmental conflicts with nearby communities, and the impact of environmental hazards on refugee populations, it is crucial to gain a better understanding of the diverse and evolving refugee environment contexts using the unique information provided by Earth observation. In this chapter, we aim to demonstrate the value of using satellite imagery and satellite-derived data to map a refugee settlement in Uganda, estimate its population, and assess the land cover changes within and around the settlement.},
